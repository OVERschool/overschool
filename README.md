# Overschool

> "Education is not preparation for life but life itself" - John Dewey

The concepts of *school* and the *classroom* have been [out of sync] with our lives for some time. This disconnect was brought into start relief during the disruption brought on by a global pandemic. Confined to our homes, families experienced first-hand the ways in which today's schools and classrooms are ill-adapted to our culture, neurodiversity, technology, and values. In the form of millions of household-sized experiments, students, families, teachers and administrators tackled obstacles of technology access, food insecurity, social-emotional needs, time managment, dominant cultural norms, and socioeconomic disparities. It was a lot.

Today, we are masked up, vaxed up, and back in school, but we've changed. The walls of our virtual existence have been knocked down, but the structure of our schools and classrooms? No signs of disturbance. The compliance-driven model of schooling is still the base design for most available forms of education. Our young people's school days are once again dominated by bells, books, binders, and boredom. When our schools stood empty, we were painfully aware of the experiences we were missing out on, but what's happening with the things we *didn't* miss? What can we do better, today, to meet the needs of all our students?

Education needs to keep experimenting. [Continuous improvement] for learning means starting with our current processes but building feedback loops and adaptability into the system.  It means developing interdisciplinary, repurpusable and, modular experiences with adapters and interfaces to accommodate  the different brains and cultures that make up our students' contexts. Learners arrive with different needs and the same intrinsic human drive for learning and self-expression. We need a way to connect, share, adapt, and expand on what we learn, how we learn, and what we can do with our learning. We are weaving a fabric that goes through school, around school, and over school. This is Overschool.

## What is Overschool?

Overschool is an approach to educational communities of practice that is built around core values. The framework borrows heavily from the agile software movement, a set of ideas and practices that have transformed software engineering from a world of big projects and excruciatingly detailed requirements documents, to one of small projects and startups that connect directly with customers to learn quickly and iterate toward viable solutions to real-world problems.

## Core Values

* Collaboration and shared understanding over presentation and recall
* Authentic projects and formative assessment over tests, grades, and summative assessment
* Coach/facilatators and learners over teachers and students
* Intrinsic motivation and emergent value over extrinsic motivation and prescribed value
