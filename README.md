# Overschool

> "Education is not preparation for life but life itself" - John Dewey

The concepts of *school* and the *classroom* have been [out of sync] with our lives for some time. In 2020, a global pandemic brought this disconnect into stark relief. Confined to home, we experienced how today's schools and classrooms are ill-adapted to our culture, neurodiversity, technology, and values. In millions of household-sized experiments, students, families, teachers and administrators tackled obstacles of technology access, food insecurity, social-emotional needs, time managment, dominant cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors in residential space. It was a lot.

Today, we are masked up, vaxed up, and back in school. We've changed, but our schools and classrooms? No signs of disturbance. The compliance-driven model of schooling still makes up the rigid framework of what most of us think of as education. The school day is once again dominated by the same bells, books, binders, and boredom. We deeply felt missing out on common experiences when our classrooms and schools stood empty, but are there also some things we *didn't* miss? What can we do better, to meet the needs of all our students?

Education needs to keep experimenting. [Continuous improvement] for learning means working with what we have and providing [adapters] for all the different brains that show up every day. Learners arrive with different needs and the same intrinsic human drive for learning and self-expression. We need a way to connect, share, adapt, and expand on what we learn, how we learn, and what we can do with our learning. We are weaving a fabric that goes through school, around school, and over school. This is Overschool.

## What is Overschool?

Overschool is an approach to educational communities of practice that is built around core values. The framework borrows heavily from the agile software movement, a set of ideas and practices that have transformed software engineering from a world of big projects and excruciatingly detailed requirements documents, to one of small projects and startups that connect directly with customers to learn quickly and iterate toward viable solutions to real-world problems.

## Core Values

Collaboration and shared understanding over presentation and recall
Authentic projects and formative assessment over tests, grades, and summative assessment
Coach/facilatators and learners over teachers and students
Intrinsic motivation and emergent value over extrinsic motivation and prescribed value
