# OVERschool

> "Education is not preparation for life but life itself" - John Dewey

The concepts of the *school* and the *classroom* have been out of sync with lives for some time. In 2020 a global pandemic brought this disconnect into stark relief. Together, and often in the same room, we experienced the way schools today are ill-adapted to our culture, neurodiversity, technology, and values. In a billion household-sized experiments, we tackled obstacles of technology access, food insecurity, social-emotional needs, time and task-managment, dominant cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors in residential space. It was a lot.

Today, we are masked up, vaxed up, and back in school. We've changed, the safety prototcols have changed, but school itself? No signs of disturbance. The compliance-driven model of schooling still makes up the rigid framework of what adults are trying so hard to build back. The school day is dominated by the same bells, books, binders, and boredom. We all know what we missed, and we can't educate our children without it, but what about what we didn't miss? What can we do better?

We need another model. It needs to work with what we have, but provide adapters for all the different brains that show up every day with different needs and the same intrinsic human drive for learning and self-expression. We need a way to connect, share, adapt, and expand on what we learn, how we learn, and what we can do with our learning. We need a fabric that goes through school, around school, and over school. This is OVERschool.
