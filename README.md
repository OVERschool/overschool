# OVERschool

> "Education is not preparation for life but life itself" - John Dewey

The concepts of school and the classroom have been out of sync with lives for some time, and in 2020 a global pandemic brought them into stark relief. Together, often in the same room,  experienced the way schools today are ill-adapted to culture, neurodiversity, technology, and values. In a billion household-sized experiments, we tackled obstacles of technology access, food insecurity, social-emotional needs, time and task-managment, dominant cultural norms, and socioeconomic factors in residential space. It was a lot.

Today, we are masked up, vaxed up, and back in school. We've changed, and prototcols have changed, but school itself? No signs of life. The compliance-driven model of schooling makes up the rigid framework of what adults are trying so hard to build back. The same bells, books, binders, and boredom are as prevalent as ever.

We need another model. It needs to work with what we have, but provide adapters for all the different brains that show up every day with the intrinsic human need for learning and self-expression. We need a way to connect, share, adapt, and expand what we learn, how we learn, and what we can do with our learning. We need a fabric that goes through school, around school, and over school. This is OVERschool.
